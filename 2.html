  Today my teacher announced that the class president election is coming up. Actually, never did I once

consider being class president before. However, this year I started thinking about it because I want to do

something to help me overcome my shyness. Therefore, I put my name on the list to run for class

president. Some of the other candidates are experienced and popular. So this probably won't be easy.
